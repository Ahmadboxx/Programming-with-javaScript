# Programming-with-javaScript

JavaScript is a high level, interpreted, programming language used to make web pages more interactive.

JavaScript is the language of the web, it is used to make the web look alive by adding motion to it. To be more precise, it’s a programming language that let’s you implement complex and beautiful things/design on web pages. When you notice a web page doing more than just sit there and gawk at you, you can bet that the web page is using JavaScript.

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)

You could compare scripts to any of the following:

# EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 
1 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2 EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 



# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

Example of a simple function

"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> 
Before the closing </body> tag, you can see the link to the JavaScript file. The JavaScript file starts with a variable used to hold a new message, and is followed by a function called updateMessage(). 
<ti tle>Basic Function</title> <link rel ="stylesheet" href="css/c03.css" /> </head> <body> <hl>TravelWorthy< /hl> <div id="message">Welcome to our site!< /div> <script src="js/basic-function.js"></script> < / body> </html>"
